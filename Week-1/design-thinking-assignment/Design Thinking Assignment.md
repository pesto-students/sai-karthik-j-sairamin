### Design Thinking Problem â€“ Two perpendicular roads meet. Both roads have one lane of traffic traveling in opposite directions. ###

Here I would like to list the essential details to keep in mind while constructing this road intersection.

1.	**Underground Sewage**: It is very important to create an underground sewage system large enough to meet the demands of this part of the city for the next 100 years. It is better to consult with the Municipality authorities to get a good understanding of this. It would be too expensive to destroy and re-create roads if this factor is not taken into consideration before doing the first iteration of laying down the road.

2.	Laying **underground electricity** and internet lines must be considered. Always leave some extra room to accommodate for increased future needs.

3.	**Underground Metro**: If this part of the city where I want to construct this roads intersection happens to be closer to an underground Metro station, maybe I can only allow vehicles up to a certain weight to pass through it. 
So, restricting all vehicles heavier than a threshold is something to consider. 

4.	Access to Pedestrians, Elderly, people with disabilities and cyclists: Needs of this category of users must be kept in mind.

5.	If this part of the city has access to plenty of sunlight, I could use **solar power** to light the streets and thus go green

6.	Installing speed & noise cameras at the intersection to identify violators and penalize them

7.	Using plastic wastes for laying the road instead of traditional construction material which is highly. This will add to the green-ness of the project

Keeping in mind the above 7 factors could greatly **decrease future upgrade/maintenance costs** and make it **very convenient for its users** in the long run.
