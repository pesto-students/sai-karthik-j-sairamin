## Effortlessly conduct online classes with Smarto ##

### Smarto’s *eMasters* System is already being used by over 150 educational institutions. ###

March 28th, 2022. **Smarto** is happy to announce *eMasters*, *eSession* & *eConference* features on its platform to enable educational institutions quickly plan and conduct online classes reliably. An educational institution of any size can register with us on the *eMasters* system using email-id & phone number. *eMasters* works as the main control panel for planning. After registration, they are asked to enter details of all classes they conduct (Eg. Class 1 – 12) along with the details (email & phone number) of all teachers/professors associated with them. On any day, each class has one or more pre-planned sessions. Each session is taken by any one registered teacher in the system.

Students of the institute are sent a one-time invite, specific to each class, to register (using email id and phone number) by the institute. 

An *eMasters* administrator of an educational institution prepares a plan of sessions to be conducted for a class on a day and assigns registered teachers to conduct those sessions. This is done at least one day in advance. After the plan is ready, each registered teacher is sent an email with separate links to all sessions they must conduct. Similarly, all registered students of a class are sent an email with separate links to join for each session. 

A session (we call it “*eSession”*) link is same for teachers and students. That link leads to Smarto’s innovative class room solution called “*eSession”*. An *eSession* is a meeting of registered students and one teacher with access to a whiteboard where the teacher can write and explain. Teachers must have access to a touchscreen laptop/tablet. They can use a stylus and write on screen and it will be replicated on students’ screens

Teachers can speak and is audible to joined students by default. Students are muted at the beginning of the *eSession* and the teacher can unmute all of them or specific student(s) to take their feedback/doubts. 
Those joining the session as registered teachers have read & write access to the whiteboard. Students have read-only access to it.

*eMasters* can also be used to track attendance, send periodic assessment links to all students of a class and promote/demote them.

*eMasters* also comes with *eConference* feature which is like an *eSession* for registered teachers. In an eConference**, there is no central admin, all participants can freely write on the whiteboard and speak. This feature can be used to conduct meetings among teachers.

We also offer white-label service to interested clients. We encourage educational institutions of all sizes to try Smarto and take advantage of our one-month free trial that expires next week.

>*“Smarto has eliminated all of our overhead costs and made us highly scalable”* said Suchitra Ramakrishnan, Vice Chancellor of University of Delhi. *“We are planning to use Smarto for our distance education programmes also”.*

> *“This is the need of the hour. We were surprised by the robustness of your offering, it has made education more accessible during these testing times”* said Erika H. James, the Dean of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. *“We thank Smarto for its revolutionary and easy to use offering. This is like AWS for educational institutions!”*

**FUNCTIONAL FAQ:**

1.	Is Smarto free to use ?

    Smarto is offering a full-fledged trial of its system to all educational institutions who register before April 1st 2022. The duration of this free trial is 30 days. 
    After 30 days, you will be reminded of the estimated costs per session based on your requirements and usage patterns.

2.	How long does it take to conduct my first session?

    After you signup as an institute, you will have access to our *eMasters* control panel. 
    Entering details of your classes, instructors, informing them, and your students will take at least 24 hours. So, you can get started in 24 hours.

3.	Our teachers and students are not tech-savvy. Will it be difficult for them?

    No, almost half of our customers are schools from tier-2/3 towns and cities where technology adoption is nascent. Having said that, basic computer literacy is necessary for the administrator to get started with our *eMasters* control panel.

    But it is very easy for teachers and students to get connected.

4.	Can you give us a discount ? We are a non-profit educational institution.

    Absolutely, please get in touch with our sales team.

**NON-FUNCTIONAL FAQ:**

1.	Is it necessary to save the whiteboard in a DB after a session is completed ?

    NO, it is not necessary because, a whiteboard/blackboard in classroom is erased and forgotten after a session is completed. So, it is unnecessary to save them in a database.

2.	What tech stack should be used?

    MERN Stack

3.	How do we reduce load on our servers?

    (a)	Only allow institutions who verify their accounts via email and phone number to add teachers.

    (b)	Teachers and students are to be invited by the institute directly. There are no other ways for teachers and students to signup unless a university invites them.


4.	What is our revenue model ?

    After the trial period is over, we will ask signed up institutes to enter credit card details.

    Since it is critical for an institute to conduct classes smoothly, we could also implement a prepaid credit like feature so that there is no interruption to institutes when there are issues with processing payments. This will ensure revenue stability.
